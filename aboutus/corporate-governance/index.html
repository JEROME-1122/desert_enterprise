                        Our team of Directors and Employees work towards achieving the Company's business interests when
                        the opportunity to do so arises. As a result, Employees and Directors are prohibited from taking
                        personal advantage of certain business opportunities in which the Company may be interested.
                        <span>
                            This so-called "corporate opportunity doctrine" is complicated and it is not possible to
                            clearly
                            define all of the business opportunities which belong or could be of interest to the Company
                            and
                            what business opportunities may be taken advantage of personally by Employees or Directors.

                        The most common types of situations falling within this corporate opportunity doctrine prohibit
                        Employees and Directors from:
                        <br><br>
                        Personally taking advantage of any business opportunity that typically would be pursued by, or
                        would be of interest to, the Company.
                        <br><br>

                        Personally taking advantage of any other business opportunity that the Company may want to take
                        advantage of if the opportunity is discovered using Company property, business contacts or
                        information, or that the Employee becomes aware of because he or she works for the Company (or
                        that a Director becomes aware of in his or her capacity as a director of the Company).
                        <br><br>

                         Competing with or otherwise disadvantaging the Company. If an Employee or Director has any
                        question regarding whether this corporate opportunity doctrine applies to any potential business
                        opportunity, he or she should consult with the Company's CEO.
                        <br><br>

                        Although Employees and Directors are free to participate in outside activities, it is important
                        that Employees and Directors not engage in any activity that is (or could appear to be) a
                        conflict between personal interests and the Company's best interests. Examples of conflicts of
                        interest include:
                        <br><br>

                        a)    Being a consultant to, or a director, officer or employee of, or otherwise operating an
                        outside business:
                        <br><br>

                        That supplies products or services to the Company.
                        <br><br>

                         That purchases products or services from the Company.
                        <br><br>

                        b)   Seeking or accepting any personal loan or services from any such outside business, except
                        from financial institutions or service providers offering similar loans or services to third
                        parties under similar terms in the ordinary course of their respective businesses.
                        <br><br>

                        c)    Being a consultant to, or a director, officer or employee of, or otherwise operating an
                        outside business if the demands of the outside business would interfere with the Director's or
                        Employee's responsibilities with the Company.

                                    This so-called "corporate opportunity doctrine" is complicated and it is not
                                    possible to

                                    is important

                        time to time by the Company in compliance with Omani Law.<span> No one may falsify or improperly
